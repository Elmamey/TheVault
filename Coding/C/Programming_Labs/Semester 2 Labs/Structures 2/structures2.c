Using Structures, write a program to store biographical data about a person.
Your program must:
a) Enter data for a person's first name, surname, date of birth (use a nested
structure), height, weight, eye colour & country of citizenship
b) Display all the data entered
c) Copy the data and store it in a 2 nd person's record. Modify the first name,
surname and date of birth only
d) Display all the data for the 2 nd person


This program does what is asked to be done above (:
